# Hello ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## Important Update

I've recently reorganized my GitHub accounts to better manage different types of projects:

- ðŸŒŸ **All of my open source projects and TypeScript tips have been moved to my new GitHub profile: [@goodmodule](https://github.com/goodmodule).** Please check it out to explore and keep up with my latest work!

- ðŸ”’ This profile will remain private and continue to host my personal projects and professional experiments.

## Why the Change?

Creating the new profile, **[@goodmodule](https://github.com/goodmodule)**, allows me to engage with the open source community without mixing these activities with my personal and professional projects. 
This separation ensures that I can maintain privacy and focus where needed, while still contributing to the community and sharing valuable insights.

## Connect with Me

While this profile will mostly contain private work, feel free to connect with me through [@goodmodule](https://github.com/goodmodule) for open source projects and developer tips. This separation helps me manage my contributions more effectively and engage with other developers and projects in the community.

Thank you for your understanding and support!

Zlatko
